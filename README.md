## H3y There!



There is nothing more fun than coding. programming is my hobby and I am always passionate about programming and always have been from the starting of my journey to the programming world when I built my first commercial desktop software in year 2009. This is the one thing in my entire life that I can do without feeling tired. I might be exhausted trying to solve a problem, but I am never bored, and I cannot fully rest until I resolve a problem. 

In this github account, I mainly share my personal fun projects which I have worked on as well as currently work in progress projects. Please feel free to contribute to my projects and thank you for visiting my code repository verse!
