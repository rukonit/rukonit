## About Me
There is nothing more fun than coding. I do not consider programming as a profession, rather I like to think it I as my hobby. I am always passionate about programming and always have been from the starting of my journey to the programming world when I built my first commercial desktop software in year 2009. This is the one thing in my entire life that I can do without feeling tired. I might be exhausted trying to solve a problem, but I am never bored, and I cannot fully rest until I resolve a problem. Growing up in developing country, I did not have many options for choosing my undergraduate degree. I ended up studying economics, But I never gave up learning programming, because I knew that someone would understand my potential one day. After completing master degree in information system, I have started my career as a database developer, but I want to do more in programming, and only a full stack developer position will give me that opportunity to fully utilize my hunger for programming.  Please have a look at my resume and code repository.
